I am a rising 5-th year Ph.D. student at Cornell University Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology advised by [Prof. Peng Chen](https://blogs.cornell.edu/chengroup/). My research lies in the field of biophysics and biophysical chemistry, and I am currently focusing on

- Super-resolution single-molecule tracking of proteins in living cells
- Single-cell temporal behavior and populational spatial pattern in bottom-up bio-communities

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
